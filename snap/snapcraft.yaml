description: |
  Mumble is a voice chat application for groups. While it can be used for any kind
  of activity, it is primarily intended for gaming. It can be compared to programs
  like Ventrilo or TeamSpeak. People tend to simplify things, so when they talk
  about Mumble they either talk about "Mumble" the client application or about
  "Mumble & Murmur" the whole voice chat application suite.
